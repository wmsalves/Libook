    git clone [https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/libook.git](https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/libook.git)
    cd libook
    ```

2.  **Set up the Backend:**
    ```bash
    # Navigate to the backend folder
    cd backend

    # Install dependencies
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Set up Environment Variables (Backend):**
    * Create a copy of the example file `.env.example` and rename it to `.env`.
    * Open the `.env` file and fill in the `DATABASE_URL` variable with your PostgreSQL connection string.
    ```env
    # .env
    DATABASE_URL="postgresql://USER:PASSWORD@HOST:PORT/DATABASE?schema=public"
    ```

4.  **Run the Database Migrations:**
    This command will create all the necessary tables in your database.
    ```bash
    npx prisma migrate dev
    ```

5.  **Start the Backend Server:**
    ```bash
    npm run start:dev
    ```
    The server will be running at `http://localhost:3000`.

6.  **Set up and Start the Frontend (when available):**
    ```bash
    # In a new terminal, navigate to the frontend folder
    cd frontend

    # Install dependencies
    npm install

    # Start the development server
